<h1>Mark's Favorite Films</h1>
<h2>My 3 all-time favorite movies.</h2>
<hr />
<ol>
<h3><li>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</li></h3>
    <p>Yes, the whole trilogy. I make the list, deal with it. I prefer the books, but like the film adaptation. Both versions are...refreshing to the soul, for lack of a better term.</p>
<h3><li>The Dark Knight Rises</li></h3>
    <p>
        If I watched the Bane movie would I cry?<br />
        It would be extremely pleasing-<br />
        You're a /kino/ guy.<br />
        -for you.<br />
    </p>
<h3><li>Cowboy Bebop</li></h3>
    <p>
        The first anime I watched, the english dub is very good, and the cast of characters is enjoyable.
    </p>
</ol>

<h4>Honorable Mentions:</h4><!--Need an indent on this-->
    <p>
        <ul>
        <li>A Hidden Life - Another "refreshing", but very tragic film about a man and his wife torn apart by Hitler's Germany.</li>
        <li>The Dark Knight - This was barely edged out by The Dark Knight Rises.</li>
        <li>Spirited Away; My Neighbor Totoro; Howl's Moving Castle by Studio Ghibli - Studio Ghibli's work is wonderful, and I encourage anyone to watch their films.</li>
        <li>Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade - A Korean political thriller anime.</li>
        <li>SCP: Dollhouse; SCP: Overlord - Short fan films, free on Youtube, directed by indie filmaker Evan Royalty.</li>
        </ul>
